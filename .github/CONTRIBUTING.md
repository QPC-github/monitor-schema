# Contributing to the Monitor Spec

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the panoptes monitor spec. 
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How Can I Contribute?

- Report bugs
- Propose or implement features
- Submit code changes / fixes
- Discuss code

See here for a [short tutorial for GitHub's issue tracking system](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Please adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting bugs

Please use the project's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/panoptes-organization/monitor-schema/issues) to report bugs. 
Since this is for a schema, bugs might be an error in the description or (eventually) implemented testing frameworks.
If you have no experience in filing bug reports, see e.g.,
[these recommendations by the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines)
first. Briefly, it is important that bug reports contain enough detail, background and, if applicable, _minimal_ reproducible sample code. 
Tell us what you expect to happen, and what actually does happen.

## Implementing features and submitting fixes

Kindly use pull requests to submit changes to the code base. But please note
that this project is driven by a community that likes to act on consensus. So
in your own best interest, before just firing off a pull request after a lot of
work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/panoptes-organization/monitor-schema/issues)
to **discuss your proposed changes first**. Afterwards, please stick to the
following simple rules to make sure your pull request will indeed be merged:


1. Fork the repo and create a [_feature
   branch_](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) from
   branch `develop`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure that all tests pass.
4. Document your code and update all relevant documentation.
5. Stick to the code and documentation style (see below).
6. Issue the pull request.

Don't forget to add your name and GitHub profile URL to the [list of contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

Important: Note that all your contributions are understood to be covered by the
[same license](../LICENSE) that covers the entire project.
